# EndlessRunner
By: Alexander Shaham, Brandon Leoung, Terence So

Commit #1:
    Created the basics for everything. Expand on runner controls,
    and further develop play scene. Additionally add obstacle and
    checkpoint objects (sprites + conditions). Use temp tile bg.
    Maybe throw in some sound stuff?

Commit #2:
    Allowed direction flipping based on movement. Created some
    backbone for the prefabs.

Commit #3:
    Added tutorial scene. Edited controls and scene linking.
    Added assets, and progressed on the runner prefab -
    working on conditions and movement.
