# EndlessRunner
By: Alexander Shaham, Brandon Leoung, Terence So

Commit Note #1:
    Created the basics for everything. Expand on runner controls,
    and further develop play scene. Additionally add obstacle and
    checkpoint objects (sprites + conditions). Use temp tile bg.
    Maybe throw in some sound stuff?
